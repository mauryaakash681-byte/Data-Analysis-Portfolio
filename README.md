# 📊 Motorola Sales Dashboard — Power BI

## 🔎 Project overview:-
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Motorola mobile sales across Indian cities, brands, and models, enabling rapid drill‑downs from company to city/model level.
Tracks core KPIs—total sales, units, transactions, AOV, and customer ratings—supported by slicers for time, city, payment method, and brand to answer specific business questions.

Tools used:-
Power BI Desktop for data modeling, visuals, and publishing workflows.
DAX measures for KPIs like AOV, YoY growth, contribution %, and rating distributions; Power Query for cleaning and shaping.

Key insights:-
Revenue snapshot: ₹64M revenue with ~2K units and ~320 transactions; AOV highlights high-value flagship sales relative to volume.
Brand performance: OnePlus leads in quantity sold while Apple contributes the highest revenue, indicating premium price mix and higher AOV.
Regional focus: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai contribute the majority share; city heatmap reveals metro-led demand concentration.
Product mix: Flagship models drive the highest per‑model revenue; mid‑range segments deliver volume but lower AOV, suggesting cross‑sell/upsell opportunities.
Payments behavior: Purchases are distributed across UPI, debit cards, and other modes; UPI share aligns with faster checkout and lower friction.
Customer sentiment: Ratings skew positive; correlation view shows higher ratings for premium devices and for cities with better service coverage.

Business impact:-
Identifies top cities and models to prioritize inventory and marketing budgets.
Surfaces brand mix and AOV levers to improve margin without sacrificing volume.
Enables quick “what‑if” filtering to support weekly sales reviews and promotions.
